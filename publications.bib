  abstract = {This chapter addresses sparse signal reconstruction under various types of structural side constraints with applications in multi-antenna systems. Side constraints may result from prior information on the measurement system and the sparse signal structure. They may involve the structure of the sensing matrix, the structure of the non-zero support values, the temporal structure of the sparse representation vector, and the nonlinear measurement structure. First, we demonstrate how a priori information in the form of structural side constraints influence recovery guarantees (null space properties) using {$\ell$}1-minimization. Furthermore, for constant modulus signals, signals with row, block, and rank sparsity, as well as non-circular signals, we illustrate how structural prior information can be used to devise efficient algorithms with improved recovery performance and reduced computational complexity. Finally, we address the measurement system design for linear and nonlinear measurements of sparse signals. To this end, we derive a new linear mixing matrix design based on coherence minimization. Then, we extend our focus to nonlinear measurement systems where we design parallel optimization algorithms to efficiently compute stationary points in the sparse phase-retrieval problem with and without dictionary learning.},

While subspace-based methods offer high-resolution parameter estimation at a low computational cost, they heavily rely on precise array calibration with a synchronized clock, posing challenges for large distributed antenna arrays. In this study, we focus on direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation within sparse partly calibrated rectangular arrays. These arrays consist of multiple perfectly calibrated sub arrays with unknown phase-offsets among them. We present a gridless sparse formulation for DoA estimation leveraging the multiple shift-invariance properties in the partly calibrated array. Additionally, an efficient blind calibration technique is proposed based on semidefinite relaxation to estimate the intersubarray phase-offsets accurately.}

  abstract = {Phase retrieval aims at recovering unknown signals from magnitude measurements of linear mixtures. In this paper, we consider the phase retrieval with dictionary learning problem, which includes another prior information that the signal admits a sparse representation over an unknown dictionary. The task is to jointly estimate the dictionary and the sparse representation from magnitude-only measurements. To this end, we study two complementary formulations and develop efficient parallel algorithms by extending the successive convex approximation framework using a smooth majorization. The first algorithm is termed compact-SCAphase and is preferable in the case of moderately diverse mixture models with a low number of mixing components. It adopts a compact formulation that avoids auxiliary variables. The proposed algorithm is highly scalable and has reduced parameter tuning cost. The second algorithm, referred to as SCAphase, uses auxiliary variables and is favorable in the case of highly diverse mixture models. It also renders simple incorporation of additional side constraints. The performance of both methods is evaluated when applied to blind channel estimation from subband magnitude measurements in a multi-antenna random access network. Simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed techniques compared to state-of-the-art methods.}

  abstract = {This dissertation is concerned with the design and analysis of approximation-based methods for nonconvex nonsmooth optimization problems. The main idea behind those methods is to solve a difficult optimization problem by converting it into a sequence of simpler surrogate/approximate problems. In the two widely-used optimization frameworks, namely, the majorization-minimization (MM) framework and the successive convex approximation (SCA) framework, the approximate function is designed to be a global upper bound, called majorizer, of the original objective function and convex, respectively. Generally speaking, there are two desiderata of the approximate function, i.e., the tightness to the original objective function and the low computational complexity of minimizing the approximate function. In particular, we focus on techniques that can be used to construct a parallelizable approximate problem so as to take advantage of modern multicore computing platforms. The first part of this thesis aims to develop an efficient parallelizable algorithmic framework based on approximation techniques for a broad class of nonconvex nonsmooth optimization problems. The classic convergence result of MM is established on the consistency of directional derivatives in all directions between the original objective function and its majorizer at the point where the majorizer is constructed. This requirement restricts the majorizer constructed at a nondifferentiable point of the original function to be also nonsmooth, which hinders its capability of simplifying nonsmooth problems since the minimization of the majorizing function, if restricted to be nonsmooth, may still be difficult. Therefore, in this thesis, we relax the derivative consistency in the majorization step so that a smooth majorizer that can be easily minimized is permitted for a wide class of nonsmooth problems.  As a result of this relaxation of derivative consistency, the smoothing majorization leads to the convergence to a stationary solution in a more relaxed sense than the classic MM. Furthermore, in contrast to minimizing the possibly nonconvex majorizing function exactly, the smoothness of the majorizing function allows us to employ the idea of SCA, along with available separable approximation techniques, to obtain an approximate minimizer of the majorizing function efficiently. Thus, we develop a parallelizable inexact MM framework, termed smoothing SCA, by combining the smoothing majorization technique and the idea of successive convex approximation. In this framework, the construction of the approximate problem at each iteration is divided into two steps, namely, the smoothing majorization and the convex approximation, so that the two desiderata of the approximate function can be treated separately. In addition, both the exact and inexact MM with smoothing majorization can be implemented block-coordinatewise to exploit potential separable structures of the constraints in the optimization problem. The convergence behaviors of the proposed frameworks are analyzed accordingly. In the second part of this thesis, as our mainly promoted framework, the smoothing SCA framework is employed to address the phase retrieval with dictionary learning problem. Two efficient parallel algorithms are developed by applying the smoothing SCA to two complementary nonconvex nonsmooth formulations, respectively, which are both based on a least-squares criterion. The computational complexities of the proposed algorithms are theoretically analyzed and both their error performance and computational time are evaluated by extensive simulations in the context of blind channel estimation from subband magnitude measurements in multi-antenna random access network, in comparison to the state-of-the-art methods.},

Our model concentrates on the conflicts of students. An exam-based conflict graph in which edges represent incompatibilities between exams is used. An exact MILP approach is directly using a MIP solver to solve the model, which is usually not able to solve real instances due to the complexity.  In order to achieve high-quality solutions within a short computational time, we propose a scalable approach based on decomposing the entire problem into subproblems, which can be easily handled using the exact MILP approach. This approach concentrates on dealing with the conflicts. The decomposition of the problem then corresponds to the decomposition of the conflict graph. For the test instances in this thesis, the scalable approach considerably improves the solutions even in shorter time, compared with the exact MILP approach.},

However, manufacturing tolerances of air-coupled ultrasonic sensors may lead to amplitude and phase deviations. Together with artifacts from imperfect knowledge of the array geometry, there are numerous factors that can impair the imaging performance of an array. We propose a reference-based calibration method to overcome possible limitations. First, we introduce a novel tensor signal model to capture the characteristics of piezoelectric ultrasonic transducers (PUTs) and the underlying multidimensional nature of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) sensor array. Second, we formulate and solve an optimization problem based on this model to obtain the calibrated parameters of the array. Third, we assess both our model and the commonly used analytic model using real data from a 3D imaging experiment. The experiment reveals that our array response model we learned with calibration data yields an imaging performance similar to that of the analytic array model, which requires perfect array geometry information.}

  abstract = {In this paper, we study the problem of recovering the direction-of-arrival in difficult scenarios of highly correlated source signals and only few available snapshots. Recently, the partial relaxation framework has been proposed as an optimizationbased technique that accounts for the existence of multiple signals while performing the estimation task through a simple spectral search. Its performance is superior to conventional methods but tends to deteriorate drastically when the source signals are highly correlated due to information loss associated with the relaxation. On the other hand, from a compressed sensing point of view, the recently proposed sparse row-norm reconstruction method formulates the parameter estimation problem as a compact $\ell_{2,1}$-mixed-norm minimization problem. One of its prominent advantages is its robustness under highly correlated sources and a low number of snapshots; an intrinsic bias induced by the $\ell_1$-norm approximation, however, affects the estimation performance. In this paper, we propose a method that integrates the  $\ell_{2,1}$-mixed-norm minimization formulation into the spectral search of the partial relaxation estimators. Simulation results show that the proposed estimator has superior error performance in difficult scenarios and alleviates the disadvantages of both methods.}

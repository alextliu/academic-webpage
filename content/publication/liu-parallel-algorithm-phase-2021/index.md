abstract: We propose a new formulation for the joint phase retrieval and dictionary
  learning problem with a reduced number of regularization parameters to be tuned.
  A parallel algorithm based on the block successive convex approximation framework
  is developed for the proposed formulation. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated
  when applied to sparse channel estimation in a multi-antenna random access network.
  Simulation results on synthetic data show the efficiency of the proposed technique
  compared to the state-of-the-art method.

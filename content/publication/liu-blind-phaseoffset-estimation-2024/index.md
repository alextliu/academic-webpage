abstract: Spatial frequency estimation from a superposition of impinging waveforms
  in the presence of noise is important in many applications. While subspace-based
  methods offer high-resolution parameter estimation at a low computational cost,
  they heavily rely on precise array calibration with a synchronized clock, posing
  challenges for large distributed antenna arrays. In this study, we focus on direction-of-arrival
  (DoA) estimation within sparse partly calibrated rectangular arrays. These arrays
  consist of multiple perfectly calibrated sub arrays with unknown phase-offsets among
  them. We present a gridless sparse formulation for DoA estimation leveraging the
  multiple shift-invariance properties in the partly calibrated array. Additionally,
  an efficient blind calibration technique is proposed based on semidefinite relaxation
  to estimate the intersubarray phase-offsets accurately.

abstract: We prove the concept that the block successive convex approximation algorithm
  can be configured in a flexible manner to adjust for implementations on modern parallel
  hardware architecture. A shuffle order update scheme and an all-close termination
  criterion are considered for efficient performance and convergence comparisons.
  Four different implementations are studied and compared. Simulation results on hardware
  show the condition of using shuffle order and selection of block numbers and implementations.

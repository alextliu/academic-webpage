abstract: The multiple measurement vectors (MMV) problem refers to the joint estimation
  of multiple signal realizations where the signal samples share a common sparse support
  over a known dictionary, which is a fundamental challenge in various applications
  in signal processing, e.g., direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. We consider the
  maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation of an MMV problem, which is classically formulated
  as a regularized least-squares (LS) problem with an elltextsubscript2,0-norm constraint
  and derive an equivalent mixed-integer semidefinite program (MISDP) reformulation,
  which can be solved by state-of-the-art numerical MISDP solvers at an affordable
  computation time. Numerical simulations in the context of DOA estimation demonstrate
  the improved error performance of our proposed method in comparison to several popular
  DOA estimation methods.

 abstract = {We consider the problem of inferring sparse Gaussian graphical models with Laplacian constraints, which can also be viewed as learning a graph Laplacian such that the observed graph signals are smooth with respect to it. A block coordinate descent algorithm is proposed for the resulting linearly constrained log-determinant maximum likelihood estimation problem with sparse regularization. Simulation results on synthetic data show the efficiency of our proposed algorithm.},

abstract: We consider the problem of inferring sparse Gaussian graphical models with
  Laplacian constraints, which can also be viewed as learning a graph Laplacian such
  that the observed graph signals are smooth with respect to it. A block coordinate
  descent algorithm is proposed for the resulting linearly constrained log-determinant
  maximum likelihood estimation problem with sparse regularization. Simulation results
  on synthetic data show the efficiency of our proposed algorithm.

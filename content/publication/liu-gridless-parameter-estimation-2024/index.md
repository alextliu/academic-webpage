abstract: Spatial frequency estimation from a mixture of noisy sinusoids finds applications
  in various fields. The widely used subspace-based methods provide super-resolution
  parameter estimation at a low computational cost. However, they require an accurate
  array calibration, which is difficult for large antenna arrays. Sparsity-based methods
  have been shown to be more robust than subspace-based methods in difficult scenarios,
  e.g., in the case with a small number of snapshots and/or correlated sources. In
  this paper, we consider the direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation in partly calibrated
  rectangular arrays comprising several calibrated and identical subarrays. We derive
  a gridless sparse formulation for DOA estimation based on the shift-invariance properties
  of the array and develop an efficient algorithm in the alternating direction method
  of multipliers (ADMM) framework. Numerical simulations show the superior error performance
  of our proposed method compared to subspace-based methods.
